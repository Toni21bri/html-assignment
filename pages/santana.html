        <h2>Carlos Santana</h2>
        <h3>He has won 10 Grammy Awards and three Latin Grammy Awards</h3>
        <p><strong>Carlos Humberto Santana Barragán</strong> born July 20, 1947) is an American guitarist who rose to fame in the late 1960s and early 1970s with his band Santana, which pioneered a fusion of Rock and roll and Latin American jazz.<br>
                   Its sound featured his melodic, blues-based lines set against Latin American and African rhythms played on percussion instruments not generally heard in rock, such as timbales and congas.<br>
                   He experienced a resurgence of popularity and critical acclaim in the late 1990s.
                   In 2015, Rolling Stone magazine listed him at No. 20 on their list of the 100 greatest guitarists.</p>
