    <h1>The Jimi Hendrix Experience</h1>
        <h2>Jimi Hendrix</h2>
        <h3>The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame describes him as "arguably the greatest instrumentalist in the history of rock music."</h3>
        <p><strong>James Marshall "Jimi" Hendrix</strong> (born Johnny Allen Hendrix; November 27, 1942 â€“ September 18, 1970) was an American guitarist, singer, and songwriter.<br>
           Although his mainstream career spanned only four years, he is widely regarded as one of the most influential electric guitarists in the history of popular music<br>
           and one of the most celebrated musicians of the 20th century.</p>

        <h3>Guitars</h3>
        <p>Hendrix played a variety of guitars, but was most associated with the Fender Stratocaster. He acquired his first in 1966, when a girlfriend loaned him enough money to purchase a used Stratocaster built around 1964.<br>
           He used it often during performances and recordings. In 1967, he described the Stratocaster as "the best all-around guitar for the stuff we're doing" he praised its "bright treble and deep bass".<br>
           Hendrix mainly played right-handed guitars that were turned upside down and restrung for left-hand playing. Because of the slant of the Stratocaster's bridge pickup, his lowest string had a brighter sound,<br>
           while his highest string had a darker sound, the opposite of the intended design. Hendrix also used Fender Jazzmasters, Duosonics, two different Gibson Flying Vs, a Gibson Les Paul, three Gibson SGs and a Fender Jaguar.<br>
           He used a white Gibson SG Custom for his performances on The Dick Cavett Show in September 1969, and a black Gibson Flying V during the Isle of Wight festival in 1970.</p>
