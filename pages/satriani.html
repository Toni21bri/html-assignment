        <h3>Guitars</h3>
        <p>Joe Satriani is well known for his signature line of Ibanez guitars. It's rare to see him without one of his JS signature models in hand, many of which sport bright, often automobile inspired, colors including Camaro Orange, Muscle Car Red, and of course his famous Chrome finish.<br>
            The Ibanez JS1 (the original JS model) was based on, and replaced, the Ibanez 540 Radius model that Satriani first endorsed. Many of his guitars are made by the company, including the JS1000 and JS1200. These guitars typically feature the DiMarzio PAF Pro.</p>
