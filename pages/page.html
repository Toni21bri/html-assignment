    <h1>Led Zepplin</h1>
        <h2>Jimmy Page</h2>
        <h3>Ranked number two in Gibson's list of "Top 50 Guitarists of All Time" and, in 2007, number four on Classic Rock's "100 Wildest Guitar Heroes".<br>
            Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice, once as a member of the Yardbirds (1992) and once as a member of Led Zeppelin (1995).</h3>
        <p><strong>James Patrick Page</strong> (born 9 January 1944) is an English musician who achieved international success as the guitarist and founder of the rock band Led Zeppelin.<br>
           Page is prolific in creating guitar riffs. His style involves various alternative guitar tunings and melodic solos, coupled with aggressive, distorted guitar tones.<br>
           It is also characterized by his folk and eastern-influenced acoustic work. He is also noted for occasionally playing his guitar with a cello bow to create a droning sound texture to the music.</p>

        <h3>Guitars</h3>
        <p>Page used a Gibson Les Paul guitar with Marshall amplification. A Harmony Sovereign H-1260 was used in-studio on Led Zeppelin III and Led Zeppelin IV and on-stage from 5 March 1971 to 28 June 1972.<br>
           During the studio sessions for Led Zeppelin and later for recording the guitar solo in "Stairway to Heaven", he used a Fender Telecaster (a gift from Jeff Beck).[106] He also used a Danelectro 3021, tuned to DADGAD,<br>
           most notably on live performances of "Kashmir". Page also plays his guitar with a cello bow, as on the live versions of the songs "Dazed and Confused" and "How Many More Times". <br>
           This was a technique he developed during his session days. On MTV's Led Zeppelin Rockumentary, Page said that he obtained the idea of playing the guitar with a bow from David McCallum, Sr. who was also a session musician.<br>
           Page used his Fender Telecaster and later his Gibson Les Paul for his bow solos.</p>
